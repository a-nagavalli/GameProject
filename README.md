# GameProject
This is a small game made using SDL. The "engine" or "framework" (using these terms very loosely) was made from scratch.

Use WASD to move. Click on an enemy to select it for targeting, then press either Q (fireball), W (ice shard), or E (thunder) to cast a spell. 

You win if you defeat all the enemies before they defeat you.
